  "course_description": "Our linked subjects are (1) the historical process by which the meaning of _technology_ has been constructed, and (2) the concurrent transformation of the environment. To explain the emergence of _technology_ as a pivotal word (and concept) in contemporary public discourse, we will examine responses \u2014 chiefly political and literary \u2014 to the development of the mechanic arts, and to the linked social, cultural, and ecological transformation of 19th- and 20th-century American society, culture, and landscape.\n\n**Note:** In the interests of freshness and topicality we regard the STS.464 syllabus as sufficiently flexible to permit some \u2014 mostly minor \u2014 variations from year to year. One example of a different STS.464 syllabus can be found in STS.464 _Cultural History of Technology_, Spring 2005.\n",
